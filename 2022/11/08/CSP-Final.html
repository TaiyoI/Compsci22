<p>This is a compliation of all of my work from this year’s AP college board quizzes</p>

<h2 id="questionsdifficulties">

<p>Overall, the questions were very difficult because I didn’t have much coding algorithm experience so I had to go online and do some researching. But overall, it started to make sense overtime. It was very similar to other algorithmic things in life like solving a rubix cube and math.</p>

<p>I was having lots of trouble on the Internet portion of the APprep part. Although, I got all the answers correct last time the internet portion of the mc was difficult. The specific question: “Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.” Stumped me because I didn’t really have much experience with routing on the internet.</p>

<p>Although the night of the museum event was only a 30 minute shift, I was able to view other classmates and other period’s projects. My group got a lot of feedback from other students as our project was not fully 100% finished. We got more inspiration from other projects. For example, changing the aesthetics of our project, adding more features such as a comment area, where you could comment on the different options of teams that we had. There especially was this one parent that questioned us about the mechanics and overall code and we were able to give them a satisfactory response and they gave us a suggestion on changing the colors of our site. I also had fun talking to others from other classes and socializing with those that weren’t in CSP and they all decided to take it next year.</p>

<h2 id="college-board-mcq-final">
<a class="anchor" href="#college-board-mcq-final" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>College Board MCQ Final</h2>
<p>Going into the Final, I was scared and nervous as the MCQ had 50 questions about a topic that two years ago was almost completely unknown to me. However, after watching the AP College board videos over the course of the trimester and also performing a lot of hands on activities such as creating our fast pages and learning on khan academy (especially the front end side). I was actually extremely surprise on my result: 46/50!!</p>

<p><strong>Here are the questions I got Wrong On the MCQ</strong></p>

<!--- This is the first question--->

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111478625/200662869-6c529e2b-01cc-42c1-809f-3f2097848409.png" alt="first question" width="1000"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet?
    <ul>
      <li>The right answer to this is: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.</li>
      <li>This is the right answer because you need a standardized way of transmission in order to create a way of transmission between different devices across different platforms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<!--- This is the second question--->

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111478625/200665666-34c83292-4c10-44b2-8c3f-c29208b5bd2d.png" alt="second question" width="1000"></p>

<ol>
  <li>A video game character can face toward one of four directions: north, south, east, and west. Each direction is stored in memory as a sequence of four bits. A new version of the game is created in which the character can face toward one of eight directions, adding northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast to the original four possibilities. Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory?
    <ul>
      <li>The right answer to this is: Four bits are enough to store the eight directions.</li>
      <li>This is the right answer because Four bits can represent 2^4, or 16 pieces of information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<!--- This is the third question--->

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111478625/201188058-e6fd9e65-768c-4574-8455-2c2fe4d7618f.png" alt="first question" width="1000"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Consider the following numeric values.</li>
</ol>

<p>Binary 1011
Binary 1101
Decimal 5
Decimal 12
Which of the following lists the values in order from least to greatest?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The right answer to this is: Decimal 5, binary 1011, decimal 12, binary 1101</li>
  <li>This is the right answer because Binary 1011 is equivalent to decimal 11 and should be placed before decimal 12.</li>
</ul>

<!--- This is the fourth question--->

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111478625/201188408-f04db78d-03f9-417c-b100-d0dde67f7064.png" alt="first question" width="1000"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Consider the following code segment.</li>
</ol>

<p>x ← 25</p>

<p>y ← 50</p>

<p>z ← 75</p>

<p>x ← y</p>

<p>y ← z</p>

<p>z ← x</p>

<p>Which of the variables have the value 50 after executing the code segment?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The right answer to this is: x and z only</li>
  <li>This is the right answer because the value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement. The fourth statement assigns the value 50 to x. The sixth statement assigns the value 50 to z.</li>
</ul>
