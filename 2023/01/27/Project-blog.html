<p>The project that my team, TeamOrbOrb is working on is called: CarHub. This platform will allow users to easily find the certain specifications such as fuel economy, used price, new price, engine specs, color options and model/brand. My part of the project involves the Inventory of the cars, filtering system that will allow the user to filter cars based on certain specifications. These specifications will include price, brand, and car type (performance, sedan, SUV, etc…). Currently the inventory solely consists of cars auto generated from chatGPT. However, in the future cars and their specs will be pulled from APIS such as CAR API and Edmund’s car API. This will meet the API requirement. Along with the Inventory feature, I will be adding a simple car quiz that evaluates the user’s most optimal car based on their choices through the quiz. The final result will communicate with my teammates profile and login feature which will allow the user to save the result of the quiz to their profile.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Discover and obtain the API: The first step is to find the API that you want to use and obtain the necessary information to access it, such as the API endpoint (URL) and any authentication keys or tokens that may be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send a request: Next, you send a request to the API endpoint using a programming language or tool of your choice, such as Python or Postman. The request should specify the type of information you want to retrieve (e.g. a specific resource, data set, or action) and any additional parameters or filters that you want to apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Receive a response: The API will respond to your request by sending back a response in the form of data, typically in a structured format such as JSON or XML. The response will contain the information that you requested, along with metadata about the request and response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Process the response: Once you have received the response, you can then process the information and use it as needed in your own application. This may involve parsing the data, transforming it into a different format, or storing it for later use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat as needed: Depending on the API, you may be able to send repeated requests to retrieve additional information or update existing information. You should check the API documentation to understand the capabilities and limitations of the API and to ensure that you are using it in an appropriate and responsible manner.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the Video plan, I will be showcasing my framework of the initial plans of what I intended to make (model of the website) and the outcome. I will be showing the functionality of the quiz and sending the final results to the profile, then I will be showcasing the filtering system in the inventory along with the API communicating the car’s information.</p>
