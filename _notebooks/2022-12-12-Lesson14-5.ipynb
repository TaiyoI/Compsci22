    "1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets look at the code below right here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11.\n",
