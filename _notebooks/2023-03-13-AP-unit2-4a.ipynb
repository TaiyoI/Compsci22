    "- **Program Usage:** This refers to the way in which programs are used to process information in an iterative and interactive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managing Data:** This involves classifying data as part of the process of using programs, and organizing data files in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insight:** The College Board suggests that insight and knowledge can be obtained from digitally represented information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter Systems:** This refers to the tools used to find information and recognize patterns within data.\n",

    "- Application: The College Board gives an example of an employee wanting to count the number of books in two databases that the preserve has.\n",

    "- **Iterative:** Refers to a process in which a sequence of instructions or code is repeated until a specific end result is achieved.\n",

    "- **OOP:** An approach to computer programming in which software design is based on objects or data, rather than functions and logic.\n",

This method scans the application for all models that inherit from db.Model and creates the corresponding tables in the database.

This is particularly useful in web applications, where users may interact with the application in unpredictable ways, and errors can occur at any time. By using try/except statements, developers can catch and handle errors, providing a better user experience and preventing security vulnerabilities."
