Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code.\n",

    "Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily."
