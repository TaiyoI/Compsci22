The game is played on a 2D array, where each cell can either be empty or contain a mine. The player's objective is to reveal all the cells that do not contain mines without detonating any mines. The player can deduce the location of mines by using the numbers on the revealed cells, which indicate the number of adjacent cells that contain mines.\n",

Each player has a grid where they place their ships, and the opposing player tries to guess the location of the ships by selecting cells on their own grid. The game is played on a 2D array, where each cell can either be empty or contain a ship. The objective of the game is to sink all the opponent's ships.\n",
