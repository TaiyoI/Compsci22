## Initial Thougts
Using all of the team memebers different coding skills this website can be able to work as a athletic website in a whole. My web design can help make the website look less boring and have videos or images and colors to direct athletes to different pages of the website. Luna, who is also in cross country and track can add in his input and help bring real facts onto this website. He can also give us experience as to his sport nd how he deals with problems when running.
