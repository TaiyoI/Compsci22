# Purpose
Creating awareness of other running athletes and gaining more traction to running as a sport
Bringing other athletes from other sports into cross country and track because it can help them improve in their other sport
Helping those who don't have resources to help them run by repurposing old running shoes and making them look new
Donating old or new running shoes to those in need of shoes or in need of shoes for their sport
Safety, bringing different exercises and stretches on the website to help those experiencing shinsplints ect. to help them find out what stretch, exercise, or help they might need for their issue

## Initial Thoughts
Using all of the team members different coding skills this website can be able to work as a athletic website in a whole. My web design can help make the website look less boring and have videos or images and colors to direct athletes to different pages of the website. Luna, who is also in cross country and track can add in his input and help bring real facts onto this website. He can also give us experience as to his sport and how he deals with problems when running.

## Code
Throughout this trimester, I have learned a lot about how to code a blog and now creating an app that can run what ever I code.
