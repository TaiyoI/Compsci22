## Link
Here is the link to my app lab: <https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/Cc-qDDjdZPYrvRCUXBVPxE5Q_7kc9zkwli2nr2dWFDo>

## Outline
- Making a quiz based on different diets
- Using different functions on the program blocks
- Changing the theme and color of the quiz
- Four Answer Options
- Using score to determine what type of diet you are associated with.
- You can easily change the type of quiz by changing the parameters.

## Building
The project initially was a bit confusing to me and I wasn't really sure where to start. However, I did have some prior experience from other sources such as FLL and code.org coding day. Using primarily the "on event" and "set screen" blocks, I was able to create a quiz that revolved around who I am. I also added a finished screen and fail screen. Along with those, I added many images to make my code pop up more. Coming up with the questions was also really fun because The project was really fun to make and I enjoyed the experience. 

## Findings
- Code.org is easier to use than python because of the blocks which allows for a better user experience
- Blocks let you add and adjust code much easier
- Website lets you view output automatically
- Can run and test programs much easier
- Can be run in your own web browser
