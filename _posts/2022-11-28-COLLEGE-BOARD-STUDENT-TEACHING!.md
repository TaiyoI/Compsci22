# College board teaching
This is the college board Mark Down file I am using to take notes on the different student teachers.

## Unit 3 Section 1-2 Notes

 * A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values).
 * Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables
 * Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings)
 * One form of a value is better suited for representation than another.

## Units 3 section 1-2 Hacks

Questions (College Board's Essential Knowledge):
1. What exactly IS a variable?

<mark>A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that</mark>

2. What is the best data type to represent someone's dog's name? 

<mark>A variable</mark>

3. Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values?

<mark>So you can call them whilst writing code.</mark>

4. What is the best way to represent someone's phone number?

<mark>You would use a string because you are not using 
the numbers of the phone number to compute anything.</mark>

- In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is

<mark>An Assignment operator is essentially the equal sign in coding.</mark>

- In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?

<mark>"<--"</mark>

- A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?

<mark>The command would display 22.</mark>


* What is a list?

<mark>a list is a sequence of elements with each element being a variable.</mark>

* What is an element

<mark>elements are the items inside a list</mark>

* What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?

<mark>Using print</mark>

* What is an example of a string?

<mark>A phone number</mark>

* Create a list with indices 
* Index a part of the list that you created.
* Try to index from the end 

nameslist = ["Taiyo", "Luna", "Ethan"] 

print(nameslist)

## Unit 3 Section 3-4 Notes

- An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways.

- Sequencing, selection, and iteration.

- Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration

## Unit 3 Section 3-4 Hacks
- You will describe the different parts of an algorithm, sequencing, selection, and iteration in the image below. 
- sequencing: <mark>The order of how to do a process</mark>
- Selection: <mark>Allows an algorithm to make a decision based on the status if a condition is met</mark>
- Iteration: <mark>A loop of doing something again and again.</mark>

num1 = 5
num2 = num1 * 3
num3 = num2 / num1 * (9 % 2) * 4
result = (num3 % num1 + num2) % num3 * 3 / 5

<mark> The Answer to this algorithmic expression is 3</mark>
