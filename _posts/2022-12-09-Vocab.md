Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms
---------------
<mark>Bits:</mark> A given byte contains either bits or a code. A designation of 'bits' means that each individual bit has its own meaning, independent of the meaning of other bits in the byte
<mark>Bytes: a group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit.
Hexadecimal / Nibbles: In communications, a nibble is sometimes referred to as a quadbit. As with any nibble, the quadbit is 4 bits and has 16 possible combinations.

Binary Numbers: According to digital electronics and mathematics, a binary number is defined as a number that is expressed in the binary system or base 2 numeral system. It describes numeric values by two separate symbols; 1 (one) and 0 (zero)
Unsigned Integer: Unsigned Integers (often called "uints") are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive)
Signed Integer: positive, negative, whole number, or zero
Floating Point: A floating point number, is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point.

Binary Data Abstractions: 
Boolean: a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”
ASCII: ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet.
Unicode: an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs.
RGB: 
red, green, and blue
RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. 

Data Compression: Data compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data.
Lossy: involving or causing some loss of data. Lossy compression is a way of getting even smaller squeezed files than lossless. 
Lossless (not discussed yet)
