# College Board Corrections

For this college board test, I did not perform to my expectations AT ALL. I was truly disappointed at my results of 21/50. However, I did learn what types of questions that I am not strong with: the logic questions. Here are also some other factors that might have come into play when I was taking this college board test.

Firstly, it could be due to a lack of understanding of the concepts. Logical reasoning and problem solving are essential skills in computer science, and it may be helpful to review the material and practice more problems to build my confidence in these areas. Consider seeking help from a teacher or tutor, or reviewing online resources to deepen my understanding.

Another reason could be test anxiety. Tests can be stressful, and it is not uncommon to feel nervous or overwhelmed during an exam. However, it is important to remain calm and focused, and to take deep breaths and relax when necessary.

It is also possible that I did not fully understand the format of the test or the instructions for each question. Make sure that I are familiar with the format of the exam and the types of questions that will be asked. Read the instructions carefully and take my time to understand what is being asked before answering.

Finally, it is possible that I simply made mistakes or did not have enough time to complete all the questions. This is a common experience for many students, and it is important to remember that mistakes are part of the learning process. Use my score as an opportunity to identify areas for improvement and to focus on my efforts on those areas in the future.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why I may have gotten the more logical type of answers wrong on the AP Computer Science Principles exam. However, it is important to keep a positive attitude and to use my score as an opportunity to improve and grow. With hard work and dedication, I can achieve my goals and succeed in my future endeavors.
