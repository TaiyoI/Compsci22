# Objective

Students will learn performance tasks requirements through the performance task examples from last year. Using the rubric provided, students will perform cross-over like grading on the different elements.

## Student 1 notes
- There were no differences between my scoring and College board's scoring. Both grades were 4/6. This was because the student did not describe their program's purpose. Moreover, they described the program's functionality and how it worked. This is a crucial point on the AP college board scoring because you need to know how to accurately describe the program's purpose. 
- The student also missed a point on the program's managing complexity meaning they were not very organized. To prevent this in the future, making a table and a framework will help make your life easier and more organized.
- All in all, I think the student has some areas to improve in, but the overall project was good.
## Student 2 notes
- My scoring was no different than AP College board's. This student deserved a 6/6 for his great demonstration along with instructions in the code it self. 
- The student went above and beyond in both the program and written areas. The student gave detailed descriptions and gave a good video example.
- For my project, I will need to follow each and every grading area carefully so I do not get docked.
