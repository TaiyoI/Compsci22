# Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes)

## Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of Facebook users are between the ages of 18 and 29, while the majority of TikTok users are between the ages of 16 and 24. This suggests that Facebook is geared more towards older users, while TikTok is geared more towards younger users. Facebook was one of the original social media companies so it attracts the older generation.

## Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

I think that virtual assistants have female voices because female voices have a softer connotation so it makes customers/users more comfortable with the virtual assistant they are talking to. It is not clear why virtual assistants often have female voices, but it could be because there is research to suggest that people find female voices more calming, trustworthy, and personable. Additionally, it may be an unconscious bias based on traditional gender roles. I think it should only be corrected if there is really a lot of controversy about this topic. However, from what I hear on the internet right now, it is not really a problem to be considered because technology such as Chat GPT is quickly replacing these virtual assistants.

## Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)

**Google**
- Google Ads
- Youtube recommendations

**Facebook**
- Facebook Ads

**Amazon**
- Amazon product recommendations

# Video Questions

Yes, the owner of the computer thinks that the computer is racist as it cannot track him, an african american.

**If yes or no, justify you conclusion.**

He says that the computer cannot track negroes.

Yes, this is harmful because people of darker skins are excluded

**Should it be corrected?**

yes, because racism is bad

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

Test more different scenarios.

# Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing (Crossover Group Up, ~10 minutes)

## We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.

I have used Car APIS for my performance project. I also have used weather API to be able to get weather information.

## We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?

I think my biggest discovery in Git Hub is being able to connect with other users.

## Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?

Yes, I did see some interesting data points. For example, the top 10 to 20 YouTube channels all had an average of over one million views, with the top channel having over seven million views. This could be indicative of the popularity of YouTube as a platform for content creators. Additionally, the top 10 to 20 Netflix channels all had an average of over one million subscribers, with the top channel having over four million subscribers. This could be indicative of the popularity of Netflix as a streaming service.
