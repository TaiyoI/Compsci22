- Q1 What is an advantage of using lossless compression instead of lossy compression?

The question is asking for a benefit of lossless compression over lossy compression. The correct answer is that lossless compression guarantees the reconstruction of the original data, whereas lossy compression does not.

- Q2 Which type of compression algorithm is best for reducing the size of a data file while still being able to restore it to its original version?

The question is asking which compression algorithm is suitable for reducing the size of a data file while maintaining the ability to restore it to its original version. The correct answer is using a lossless compression algorithm.

- Q3 What is a true statement about compression?

The question is asking for a correct statement about compression. The scenario presented is a social media platform developer seeking advice on which type of image compression to use. The answer is that they should most likely use lossy compression since it provides less transmission time, although some information may be lost during compression.

Application of these questions
These questions were designed to help differentiate between lossless and lossy image compression. Understanding the differences between the two can be useful in everyday life, especially for those who use social media regularly.

- Q1 Bookstore Spreadsheet

In the Bookstore Spreadsheet question, an employee wants to find out the number of mystery books that cost less than $10 and have at least one copy in stock. The expression that would give the desired output is "(genre = "mystery") AND ((1 â‰¤ num) AND (cost < 10.00))". This is because all of the given data needs to be considered, and using OR statements would not give the desired result.

- Q2 Clothing store sales information

The Clothing Store Sales Information question involves a store owner who tracks dates, payment methods, number of items, and dollars paid for every transaction. The question asks which statement is true during a 7-day period. The owner can easily track the number of items purchased over the 7-day period by adding up the number of items purchased each day. Although it does not seem directly related to programming, it is a straightforward problem to solve.

- Q3 Data files to contact customers who use batteries

The Data Files to Contact Customers Who Use Batteries question involves a company that wants to use their data files to determine which customers would be the best fit to target in an email campaign for their rechargeable battery pack. The best approach would be to compare customer IDs to item purchase IDs to identify potential customers who may be interested in the product.

- Q4 Museum photograph spreadsheet

The Museum Photograph Spreadsheet question involves a spreadsheet of information about photographs in a museum's collection. The problem is to find which photographer took the oldest picture in the collection. The solution is to filter by photographer and sort by year or vice versa to get the years of each photo in order of the photographer who took them.

- Q5 Radio Show Spreadsheet

The Radio Show Spreadsheet question involves a spreadsheet with information about the schedule for a college radio station, including show name, genre, day, start time, and end time. The problem is to count the number of shows that are both a talk show and on a Saturday or Sunday. The best expression to output a true statement would be "(genre = "talk") AND ((day = "Saturday") OR (day = "Sunday"))". This is because both conditions must be met for a show to be included.

- Use of Databases to display animal information

The Use of Databases to Display Animal Information question involves a preserve that wants to develop an interactive exhibit with information about each animal based on the guest's selection. They have two databases of information available for the exhibit. The first database contains information about the animal's name, classification, skin type, and thermoregulation, while the second database contains information about the animal's name, lifestyle, average life span, and top speed. Both of these databases are necessary for the exhibit as they contain the specific data required to develop the interactive exhibit.
