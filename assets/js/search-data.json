            "content": "Vocab . Collatz . The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . . Hacks . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be.

Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity .

Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string!

Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 .

It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names . choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . bash def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables . | . function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . . 3 . 5 .

The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . More information . Hacks/Assignment . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment . Write 2 algorithms: One is efficent and one is innefficent, then explain why one is efficent while the other isn&#39;t. (.25) | Explain why one algorithm is more efficient than another using mathematical and/or formal reasoning.

AP College Board Experience . This is a compliation of all of my work from this year’s AP college board quizzes . Questions/Difficulties . Overall, the questions were very difficult because I didn’t have much coding algorithm experience so I had to go online and do some researching. But overall, it started to make sense overtime. It was very similar to other algorithmic things in life like solving a rubix cube and math. . MCQ College Board PT.2 . I was having lots of trouble on the Internet portion of the APprep part. Although, I got all the answers correct last time the internet portion of the mc was difficult. The specific question: “Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.” Stumped me because I didn’t really have much experience with routing on the internet. . Experience of Night At The Museum . Although the night of the museum event was only a 30 minute shift, I was able to view other classmates and other period’s projects. My group got a lot of feedback from other students as our project was not fully 100% finished. We got more inspiration from other projects. For example, changing the aesthetics of our project, adding more features such as a comment area, where you could comment on the different options of teams that we had. There especially was this one parent that questioned us about the mechanics and overall code and we were able to give them a satisfactory response and they gave us a suggestion on changing the colors of our site. I also had fun talking to others from other classes and socializing with those that weren’t in CSP and they all decided to take it next year. . College Board MCQ Final . Going into the Final, I was scared and nervous as the MCQ had 50 questions about a topic that two years ago was almost completely unknown to me. However, after watching the AP College board videos over the course of the trimester and also performing a lot of hands on activities such as creating our fast pages and learning on khan academy (especially the front end side). I was actually extremely surprise on my result: 46/50!! . Here are the questions I got Wrong On the MCQ . . Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet? The right answer to this is: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. | This is the right answer because you need a standardized way of transmission in order to create a way of transmission between different devices across different platforms. | . | .

Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory? The right answer to this is: Four bits are enough to store the eight directions. | This is the right answer because Four bits can represent 2^4, or 16 pieces of information. | . | .

The right answer to this is: Decimal 5, binary 1011, decimal 12, binary 1101 | This is the right answer because Binary 1011 is equivalent to decimal 11 and should be placed before decimal 12. | . . Consider the following code segment. | x ← 25 . y ← 50 . z ← 75 . x ← y . y ← z . z ← x . Which of the variables have the value 50 after executing the code segment? . The right answer to this is: x and z only | This is the right answer because the value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement. The fourth statement assigns the value 50 to x. The sixth statement assigns the value 50 to z. | .",

The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher); // before role logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // set the role logItType(teacher); logItType(teacher.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Taiyo&quot;, &quot;TaiyoI&quot;, 2025), new Person(&quot;Rohin&quot;, &quot;rohinsood&quot;, 2025), new Person(&quot;Ethan&quot;, &quot;realethantran&quot;, 2025), new Person(&quot;Luna&quot;, &quot;lunaiwa&quot;, 2025), new Person(&quot;Parav&quot;, &quot;paravsalaniwal&quot;, 2025), ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . object ; [ Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Taiyo&#39;, ghID: &#39;TaiyoI&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Rohin&#39;, ghID: &#39;rohinsood&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Ethan&#39;, ghID: &#39;realethantran&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Luna&#39;, ghID: &#39;lunaiwa&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Parav&#39;, ghID: &#39;paravsalaniwal&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; } ] string ; Mr M string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} object ; { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } . IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .
