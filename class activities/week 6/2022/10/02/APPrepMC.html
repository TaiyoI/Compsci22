<p>Overall, the questions were very difficult because I didn’t have much coding algorithm experience so I had to go online and do some researching. But overall, it started to make sense overtime. It was very similar to other algorithmic things in life like solving a rubix cube and math.</p>

<p>I was having lots of trouble on the Internet portion of the APprep part. Although, I got all the answers correct last time the internet portion of the mc was difficult. The specific question: “Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.” Stumped me because I didnt really have much experience with routing on the internet.</p>
